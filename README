- i made this because I didn't want to have to do line calculation in math class. 
- this eventually inspired another code that i made for another math topic. 
- i added termcolor because I thought that made my program look cooler, but now i think it's impractical because if I wanted to make that an executable, python can't 
really add the colors(or at least from a test). 
- feel free to use this for ur math. if you chnage the code lemme know abt it. I'd like to see what could be done with this!
